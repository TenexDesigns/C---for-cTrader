C# is a rich and expressive language with various keywords that serve different purposes. Here are some essential keywords in C# along with code samples:

1. **class:**
   - Defines a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.

   ```csharp
   public class MyClass
   {
       // Class members and methods
   }
   ```

2. **namespace:**
   - Defines a namespace, which organizes code into logical groups.

   ```csharp
   namespace MyNamespace
   {
       // Classes, methods, and other members
   }
   ```

3. **using:**
   - Imports namespaces to simplify type references.

   ```csharp
   using System;

   namespace MyNamespace
   {
       public class MyClass
       {
           public void MyMethod()
           {
               Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **public/private/protected/internal:**
   - Access modifiers that control the visibility of types and members.

   ```csharp
   public class MyClass
   {
       private int _myField;

       public void MyMethod()
       {
           // Access _myField here
       }
   }
   ```

5. **static:**
   - Specifies that a member belongs to the type itself rather than to instances of the type.

   ```csharp
   public static class MathHelper
   {
       public static double Square(double x)
       {
           return x * x;
       }
   }
   ```

6. **new:**
   - Creates instances of classes or invokes constructors.

   ```csharp
   MyClass obj = new MyClass();
   ```

7. **override:**
   - Indicates that a method overrides a base class method.

   ```csharp
   public class MyBaseClass
   {
       public virtual void MyMethod()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Base class method");

       public override void MyMethod()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Derived class method");
       }
   }
   ```

8. **async/await:**
   - Enables asynchronous programming, allowing methods to execute asynchronously.

   ```csharp
   public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
   {
       // Asynchronous operation
       await Task.Delay(1000);
       return "Data";
   }
   ```

   - Used for exception handling to catch and handle exceptions.

   ```csharp
   try
   {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       // Handle the exception
   }
   finally
   {
       // Clean-up code
   }
   ```

10. **foreach:**
    - Iterates over elements in collections such as arrays or lists.

    ```csharp
    int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

```csharp
public class MyCBot : cTrader.CBot.CBot
{
  private double shortMALength; // Private property (accessible only within the class)
  public void OnBar() // Public method (accessible from outside the class)
  {
    // ...
  }
}
```

* **if, else, else if:** Conditional statements used to control program flow based on certain conditions.

```csharp
public override void OnBar()
{
  if (Symbol.Ask > Symbol.High[1]) // Check price condition
  {
    Order.Place(Order.OrderType.Buy, Symbol, Volume, null, null);
  }
  else if (Symbol.Bid < Symbol.Low[1]) // Else if condition
  {
    Order.Place(Order.OrderType.Sell, Symbol, Volume, null, null);
  }
}
```

* **for, foreach, while:** Looping constructs used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a condition is met.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < indicators.Count; i++) // Loop through indicators
{
  Console.WriteLine(indicators[i].Name);
}
```

* **using:** Used to import namespaces and dispose of resources after use.

```csharp
using System; // System namespace for core functionalities

public class MyCBot : cTrader.CBot.CBot
{
  public override void OnBar()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("New bar on {0}", Symbol.Name);
