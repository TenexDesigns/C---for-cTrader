cTrader has migrated to the latest .NET 6 version with the release of cTrader Desktop 4.2, which was announced on March 30, 2022. This update brings many new features for developers, including support for C# 10, improved IntelliSense, and the ability to use any IDE for working on algos, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider. The migration to .NET 6 provides numerous benefits, including the ability to reference other libraries from NuGet, integrate with .NET products like ASP.NET, WPF, WinForms, and ML.NET, and compile cBots and indicators using the 'dotnet build' command. This also allows for compiling code and running it on Linux or Mac [1].

The cTrader application now includes a new installer and updater, which works better than the previous installation technology and provides a better user experience. This includes the ability to launch the old cTrader version while an update is in progress. Additionally, the platform now supports both .NET 4.x and .NET 6 for algos, ensuring backward compatibility for existing cBots and indicators. New cBots and indicators targeting .NET 6 will run in different processes using .NET 6, while old cBots and indicators will be launched in a child process running .NET Framework 4.x. This approach maintains great backward compatibility and brings the latest .NET technology to new projects [1].

The support for .NET 6 in cTrader indicates a commitment to providing developers with the latest tools and features for creating cBots and indicators. However, the specific duration for which .NET 6 will be supported in cTrader is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources. It's common for software platforms to support the latest versions of .NET for several years, but the exact timeline would depend on the platform's release schedule and support policies. For the most current information on support timelines, it's recommended to consult the official cTrader documentation or contact their support team directly.
