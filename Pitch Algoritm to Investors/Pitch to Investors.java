Developing a trading strategy and algorithm that aims to achieve a consistent 10-pip profit across 20 different markets on the same day is an ambitious goal. Achieving such a feat requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, sophisticated algorithmic design, and rigorous backtesting to ensure the strategy's viability. Here's a structured approach to developing and presenting your trading strategy, inspired by the story of Dave Cummings and the principles of algorithmic trading.

### 1. Developing Your Trading Strategy

- **Understand the Market**: Before writing any code, thoroughly research the markets you intend to trade in. Understand the liquidity, volatility, and trading hours of each market.
- **Define Your Strategy**: Clearly outline the conditions under which your strategy will enter and exit trades. This includes the technical indicators or patterns you'll use to identify trading opportunities.
- **Backtesting**: Use historical data to test your strategy. This step is crucial for understanding how your strategy would have performed in the past and for identifying any potential issues. Tools like PyBroker can help with backtesting and strategy development [9].

### 2. Implementing Your Algorithm

- **Programming Knowledge**: You'll need a solid understanding of programming, preferably in a language like C# or Python, which are commonly used in algorithmic trading.
- **Access to Trading Platforms**: Ensure you have access to trading platforms that support algorithmic trading and can execute your strategy.
- **Network Connectivity and Market Data Feeds**: Your algorithm will need to access real-time market data and execute trades. This requires a stable internet connection and access to reliable market data feeds [1].

### 3. Presenting Your Strategy

- **Prepare a Presentation**: Create a compelling presentation that clearly explains your strategy, its rationale, and the backtesting results. Highlight the unique aspects of your strategy that make it potentially profitable.
- **Showcase Your Results**: Use visual aids like charts and graphs to demonstrate the performance of your strategy during backtesting. This can help potential investors understand the potential returns.
- **Explain the Technical Aspects**: Briefly explain the technical aspects of your algorithm, such as how it identifies trading opportunities and manages risk. This can help investors understand the complexity and sophistication of your strategy.

### 4. Approaching Investors and Trading Firms

- **Networking**: Attend industry events, conferences, and meetups to network with potential investors and trading firms.
- **Personalized Approach**: When approaching firms, tailor your pitch to their interests and capabilities. Highlight how your strategy can complement their existing portfolio or offer unique opportunities.
- **Demonstrate Confidence**: Confidence in your strategy and its potential for success can be contagious. Present your pitch with clarity and conviction.

### 5. Next Steps

- **Further Development**: Based on feedback, refine your strategy and algorithm. Continuous improvement is key in algorithmic trading.
- **Scaling Up**: Once you've secured initial capital, consider scaling up your strategy to trade in more markets or increase the size of your positions.

### Resources

- **PyBroker**: A Python framework for developing algorithmic trading strategies, including those that use machine learning [9].
- **Investopedia**: Offers comprehensive articles on algorithmic trading, including technical requirements, strategies, and examples [1].

Developing and presenting a trading strategy like the one you're envisioning is a significant undertaking. However, with the right approach, technical skills, and a compelling presentation, you can attract the attention of potential investors and trading firms. Remember, the journey from idea to execution is fraught with challenges, but with persistence and a solid foundation, your strategy has the potential to succeed.
